   - Swaps IDs to access other users' data
   - Tests both sequential numeric IDs and UUIDs
   - Terminal Message: `[Shadow Logic] IDOR Hypothesis: ID 'user_42' can be swapped to 'user_43' to access other users' data... TESTING.`

#### 4. **Race Condition Testing**

   - Simulates concurrent requests for double-spending attacks
   - Tests for refund loop vulnerabilities
   - Terminal Message: `[Shadow Logic] Race Condition Hypothesis: Can we redeem the same code twice with concurrent requests? ... TESTING.`

#### 5. **Privilege Escalation Logic**
   - Hunts for hidden privilege parameters (is_admin, role, permissions, level)
   - Tests parameter injection in POST/PUT requests
   - Attempts 0xFFFFFFFF privilege bitmask bypass

Before proceeding to the commercial phase (Stripe/Payment integration), we need a final architectural review to confirm that all agents are fully operational and adhere to the two-tier execution strategy discussed:1. 🧠 Core Agents Readiness Check (Agents 1-5, 7)Please confirm the following core functionalities are fully ready and stable:Agent 3 (RL Exploiter) & Agent 5 (Prophet): Confirm that the Causal Inference Engine and RL Exploiter optimization are fully integrated and successfully persisting complex results (Financial Modeling, ATT&CK mapping) to agentResults.Zero-Day Template Generation: Confirm that the logic for translating Mock Threat Feed Data into a working, exclusive Nuclei YAML template is operational.Goal: The system must prove it can utilize the computational power to generate new scanning logic without relying on external LLM APIs (Perplexity, etc.).2. 🛡️ Autonomous Defense Agent (Strategy Check)This is the most critical check for the ELITE tier value proposition. Please confirm the implementation supports the following Fallback Strategy:ScenarioExecution MethodConfirmation NeededA. Full Automation (Customer provided API Key)The Agent successfully uses the client's stored Cloudflare/AWS WAF API Key to send the blocking rule.Code paths are ready to consume and decrypt a stored client API key for execution.B. Manual Fallback (No API Key Provided)The Agent does NOT halt but generates the blocking rule and places it in the final report as a "Copy-Paste Rule".The fallback logic is active, preventing service halt and providing the user with a manual solution instead of failing the scan.3. 🔑 Missing Link: Client API Key InputPlease ensure we have a plan to implement the necessary UI/UX to safely handle the client's defense API keys:Action: Confirm the next step involves creating a secure "Integrations Settings" UI component where ELITE clients can safely input their WAF/Cloud API keys for storage and use by the Autonomous Defense Agent.Expected Outcome: All agents are proven functional, and the system is ready to deliver both automated and manual fixes based on customer configuration.

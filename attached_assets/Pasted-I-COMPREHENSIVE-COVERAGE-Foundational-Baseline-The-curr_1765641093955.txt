I. 👑 COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE (Foundational Baseline)
The current Agents (1-4) must be validated and expanded to fully cover these critical, high-value attack surfaces:

🌐 API Security: Implement checks for BOLA, Mass Assignment, and Rate Limiting using available specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).

☁️ Cloud/SaaS Security (CSPM): Agent 2 must perform deep scanning for IAM/S3 Misconfigurations and exposed cloud resources.

📱 Mobile Applications: Integrate static analysis checks for Insecure Data Storage and basic Reverse Engineering prevention.

⚙️ CI/CD Pipelines: Implement Agent 1/2 logic for scanning repositories for Hardcoded Secrets and performing Dependency Flaw detection within build configurations.

II. ⚡ ABSOLUTE MAX POWER (The Market Differentiators)
These capabilities justify the Elite Tier pricing and define ShadowTwin's dominance:

A. 🧠 Introducing Agent 5: The Prophet (Predictive AI)

Mission: Predictive Threat Analysis. Agent 5 must utilize AI/ML models to analyze code changes and historical scan data to predict where the next security vulnerability will emerge before the code is finalized.

B. 👻 Stealth & Chaining Exploitation

Agent 3 Enhancement: Must be capable of Evasion (bypassing WAFs/IDS/IPS during exploit execution) and Chaining multiple low/medium-severity vulnerabilities (e.g., LFI + CSRF) to achieve Critical-level access.

C. 🎯 Customized Threat Intelligence

Agent 4 Enhancement: Must integrate Threat Actor Profiling, analyzing discovered vulnerabilities against global APT group tactics to identify the potential attacker, transforming technical reports into executive-level strategic intelligence.

III. ✅ Confirmation & Next Steps
Financial Integrity: Ensure the Credits system and Approval Gates are perfectly functioning.

Mandate: The team is required to confirm receipt and provide an immediate plan for integrating Agent 5 and the Stealth/Chaining enhancements within the next development sprint.

We are building the future. Execute with maximum priority.

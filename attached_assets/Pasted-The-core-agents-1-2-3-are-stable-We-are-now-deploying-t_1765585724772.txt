The core agents (1, 2, 3) are stable. We are now deploying the final layer: Agent 4 (Reporter Agent). This agent is critical for justifying the ELITE tier pricing by providing strategic, decision-grade intelligence.

I. 👑 ELITE TIER REQUIREMENTS (MAX POWER)
Agent 4 must operate using GPT-5.1 for the ELITE tier and must implement the following strategic capabilities:

Financial Risk Quantifier:

Goal: Move beyond simple severity (High/Critical).

Implementation: Generate a quantifiable financial risk assessment for each critical finding, providing an Estimated Loss Range (e.g., $50K - $150K) based on asset value and downtime probability.

Executive Summary Customization:

Tone Shift: The report must adapt its language and focus based on the target audience (e.g., using ROI and Liability language for the CFO/CEO, and technical specifics for the Development Team).

Format: Generate a concise, single-page Board-Level Executive Summary.

Strategic Benchmarking:

Implementation: Include a dedicated section comparing the client's current security posture against relevant Industry Best Practices and data from similar companies (derived from GPT-5 synthesis) to drive immediate executive action.

Evidence Integration:

Must Embed: The final report must directly embed Exploitation Artifacts (Screenshots/Logs) and the Remediation Code Snippets generated by Agent 2, providing irrefutable proof and immediate fix instructions.

II. ⏱️ TEMPORAL AWARENESS & LIABILITY LOGIC
Agent 4 must integrate with the main system to ensure continuous service and legal defense:

Liability Log: A standardized "Security Status History" section must be included in the Executive Summary, detailing the date of last full scan and confirmed remediation efforts.

Metadata Passing: Ensure metadata is correctly passed back to Agent 1 to enable the tracking of Verification Scans and the system's ability to trigger Emergency Micro-Scans upon new global CVEs.

III. 📄 FINAL OUTPUT FORMATS
The system must deliver three distinct, high-quality outputs:

Executive PDF: (Branded, High-Level Decisions).

Technical PDF: (Full Detail, PoC Code, Remediation Instructions).

Raw Data Export: (CSV/JSON for client's security systems integration).

This finalizes the entire ShadowTwin architecture. Proceed with implementation and unit testing for Agent 4.

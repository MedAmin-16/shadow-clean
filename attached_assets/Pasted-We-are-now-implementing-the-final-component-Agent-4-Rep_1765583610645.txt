We are now implementing the final component: Agent 4 (Reporter Agent). This agent must transform the powerful findings of Agents 1, 2, and 3 into high-value, defensible, and actionable business intelligence, justifying the Elite price point.

1. ⚙️ CORE PROCESSING & LLM GATING
Agent 4 must strictly utilize GPT-5.1 for the ELITE plan to handle complex analysis and strategic tone shifts. The base cost for report generation must be calculated and deducted upon initiation.

2. 👑 ELITE REPORT REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTE MAX POWER)
Agent 4 must generate a comprehensive report that is defensible and strategic:

Financial Risk Analysis: Generate a quantifiable financial risk score and estimated loss range for critical vulnerabilities, focusing on the cost of non-compliance (e.g., GDPR fines) and service downtime.

Executive Summary: Create a single-page, Board-Level summary emphasizing financial impact, strategic priorities, and an Audience Tone Shift based on the target audience (CFO/CEO/Dev Team).

Strategic Benchmarking: Integrate a section that compares the client's security posture against Industry Best Practices and the average security level of similar companies, using data synthesized by GPT-5.

Evidence Integration: The report must embed all Artifacts (Screenshots, Verified Logs) and the PoC Code from Agent 2/3 as non-disputable proof.

Actionable Remediation: Include the exact Remediation Code Snippets or configuration fixes generated by Agent 2, making the solution immediately available to development teams.

3. ⏱️ TEMPORAL AWARENESS & LIABILIT Y LOGIC
Agent 4 must ensure system continuity and legal protection:

Liability Log Generation: The Executive Summary must include a concise "Security Status History" section summarizing the dates of last full scan, remediation status, and critical findings reported.

Metadata for Continuous Service: Agent 4 must pass metadata to the main system to enable:

Verification Scans: Tracking of fixed vulnerabilities for future, lower-cost validation scans.

Emergency Micro-Scans: Enabling the system to trigger automated, focused scans upon detection of new global CVEs affecting the client's technology.

4. 📄 FINAL OUTPUT FORMATS
Agent 4 must deliver the report in three essential formats:

Executive PDF: The final, branded PDF focusing on business decisions.

Technical PDF: The full, detailed report.

Raw Data Export: A downloadable CSV/JSON file for direct integration into client security tools.

Please review and confirm the successful completion of all the following technical and security points. These measures are crucial to guarantee operational continuity, security, and legal compliance before we begin charging $4,999 for the ELITE package.

We must ensure that all Agents operate at "Max Power" without any legal or technical vulnerabilities that could lead to service interruption (Downtime).

I. 🛡️ Security and Compliance Audit
Secret Management:

Action: Confirm that all sensitive API keys, database credentials, and internal Agent 5 keys are 100% migrated to secure environment files (.env or Secrets Manager).

Goal: Prevent exposure of sensitive data in case of code breach.

Legal Usage Restrictions (Agent 3):

Action: Implement a technical Blacklist within Agents 2 and 3 code to automatically refuse scanning highly sensitive targets (e.g., specific Gov/Bank domains).

Goal: Shield the platform from legal liability and malicious use.

Comprehensive Audit Logging:

Action: Enable detailed logging for every scan (who initiated, when, and the target) and store it in the database.

Goal: Provide a vital legal and technical defense record.

II. ⚡ Performance and Stability
Robust Error Handling & Uptime:

Action: Implement strong try...catch blocks across all Agents. If any Agent (especially 3 or 5) fails, it must log the error and terminate safely without causing a server crash.

Goal: Ensure stable service and prevent downtime.

Speed and Scalability (Latency):

Action: Confirm the full scan pipeline (Agent 1 to Agent 5) operates asynchronously and the Time-to-Completion does not exceed 15 minutes.

Goal: Offer a competitive service and maintain performance under load.

Agent 5 Memory Management:

Action: Verify that Agent 5's ML models perform effective memory cleanup (release RAM) immediately after finishing a prediction task.

Goal: Prevent memory leaks and excessive resource consumption on the server.

III. 🌐 AWS Deployment Readiness
Database Schema Finalization (DB):

Action: Ensure the Users, Credits, and Scans_History database tables are finalized and ready to handle commercial data and the credits system.

Goal: Essential for Stripe integration and accurate billing.

Outbound Firewall Configuration (AWS Lightsail):

Action: When deploying on AWS Lightsail, confirm that all necessary outbound ports (80, 443, 21, 22, etc.) are open in the security group/firewall.

Goal: Agents 2 and 3 require outbound access to successfully execute a scan.
